<h1>Unit 3 Final Project: Physics Piano</h1>

<strong>Interaction</strong>: I am using minim and Box2D to play musical blocks.

<strong>Description</strong>: This game will consist of a box that can be thrown around, inside boundaries at each side of the screen. And there will be particles falling from the top side. And every time the box comes in contact with the particles, the particles get destroyed and play a note.

  <h3>Milestone #1: April 25th, 2016 </h3>
  <strong>Goal:</strong> You should have solid planning done by the end of this milestone.
  <ul>
    <li>first task : Learn how to use minim.</li>
    <li>second task : Learn how to use Box2D.</i>
    <li>third task : Create a box that can be thrown around.<li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Milestone #2: May 2nd, 2016 </h3>
  <strong>Goal:</strong> You should have a small prototype by the end of this milestone.
  <ul>
    <li>first task : Make the killbody() function work, meaning whenever the box comes into contact with a particle.</li>
    <li>second task : Create the boundary at the bottom.
    <li>third task : make it so that whenever the box comes into contact with a particle, it plays a note in function of the size of the particle.
  </ul>
